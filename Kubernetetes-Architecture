Talking about architecture, we are going to look at it in two angles: From the Control Plane and Nodes

CONTROL PLANE:

It basically is the command center in any kube cluster. Below are the main tools that make up the control plane.
API SERVER:
It could be seen as the heart of the control plane. It grants access to the control nodes from enetities from outside the cluster.
SCHEDULERr:
It is used to maintain order within the cluster (nodes). It could be said to be a rule enforcer because the rules set within the API are put into play by the help of the scheduler. In other words, it pinpoints where commands are issued within the data plane.
CONTROL MANAGER:
It is used to direct certain instructions to designated nodes to ensure efficient funtioning of nodes within a cluster. An example being the replica setting, should in a case a node is about to die another pod is spinned up automatically. In short we could say it monitors the pods within a cluster. 
etcd:
In short we could look at it as a data store which saves the commands made within the control plane.

DATA PLANE/ NODE:

Sometimes referred to as worker nodes, they carry out the heavy lifting within the cluster. They usually contain the applications of the client or customers.
Below are the main tools that make it up;
KUBELET: 
It aims at monitoring what happenings within the container and if some pod is having some "health issues" then kubelet ensure this is rectified to maintain smooth functionality of the application.
KUBE PROXY:
This controls the networking within that container and in usually aimed at assigning ip addrresses to the pods. It also directs traffic (load balancing) to the right pods for application efficiency
CONTAINER RUNTIME:
It is used to run the container
